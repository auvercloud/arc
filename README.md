Components of AuverCloud runtime client version 3:

##css##
- _arc.3.css_: Default stylesheet for AuverCloud contents (e.g. text, menu, slideshow)
- _opensans_ folder: Subset of Open Sans font definition (normal, italic, bold, italic-bold). The original font definition is on [Google font](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans). Open Sans font is part of this package as it is the only font available in the AuverCloud Studio that is not 100% web proof. 

##js##
- _arc.3.js_: JavaScript client for the AuverCloud API. It includes a cross-domain REST client based on jQuery Ajax client, a loader for AuverCloud contents and some utilities. _arc.js_ requires _jQuery version 2 or more.

##min##
- _arc.3.min.js_: This is the minified version of _arc.js_. Recommended for production.

##php##
- _arc.3.php_: PHP client for the AuverCloud content server. It enables the integration of AuverCloud content in PHP pages.
